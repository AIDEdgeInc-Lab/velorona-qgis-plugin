"""Versioned document contracts shared by Velorona QGIS and Velorona Map.

Both products read and write the same two JSON documents:

    velorona.workflow / 1   a saved, reusable analysis configuration
    velorona.run / 1        the immutable record of one execution of it

The version is an integer in the document itself. A reader accepts any version
it knows and refuses (never rewrites) a newer one, so an older install cannot
damage a record written by a newer one. Pure stdlib -- no QGIS import.
