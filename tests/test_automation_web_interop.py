"""A backup written by Velorona Map (real Chromium, IndexedDB, browser-side zip writer) must restore in the plugin.

tests/fixtures/web_backup_v1.zip was produced by tests/js/automation_browser_check.js in the Velorona Map repo (branch
feat/map-automation). The elevation service was stubbed there (flat 100 m terrain), so the results are synthetic even though the
run records name the real terrain source. It holds one workflow and two runs of a 7-row file (5 analysable rows, one of them with a
formula-like link_id, and 2 rejected rows), and is committed as-is: a schema change that breaks reading it needs a migration.
